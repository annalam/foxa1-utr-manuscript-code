This repository contains code used to generate the results in study "Frequent mutation of the FOXA1 untranslated region in prostate cancer", published in Nature Communications Biology.

Data analysis code was run with version 0.6.2 of the Julia programming language.

Somatic mutation analysis code (mutato.rs) was compiled with version 1.27 of the Rust programming language, but should also work on more recent versions of Rust due to backwards compatibility guarantees of the language.
